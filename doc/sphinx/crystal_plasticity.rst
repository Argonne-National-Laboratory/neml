Crystal plasticity
==================

This submodule of NEML provides models for the constitutive response of single
crystals that deform though a combination of recoverable elastic deformation
and unrecoverable inelastic slip or twinning. 
These constitutive models are implemented through the :ref:`large deformation incremental <NEMLModel_ldi>` interface, meaning the constitutive model is
defined incrementally through the symmetric and skew parts of the 
spatial velocity gradient.
