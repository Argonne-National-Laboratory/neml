Advanced topics
===============

These topics are only important if you are going to add new material 
model components to NEML.
They describe the mathematical helpers used in NEML to do common
operations on tensors in Mandel notation, the class used to solve
nonlinear equations, and the object system used to manage all the 
individual components in NEML and generate XML input and the python bindings.
