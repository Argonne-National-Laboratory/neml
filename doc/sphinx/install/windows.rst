Windows
=======

We compile and test neml on Windows using the `MSYS2 <https://www.msys2.org/>`_
system.  This provides a linux-like build environment for Windows.  We 
build and test the library using the `mingw-w64 <http://mingw-w64.org>`_
compiler.  MSYS2 supports other compilers and if needed you may be able to
compile and run neml using one of the other support compilers.  These directions
assume the use of mingw.
